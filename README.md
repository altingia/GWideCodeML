# **GWideCodeML:** an automatic pipeline for testing evolutionary hypothesis at the genome-wide level.

## Description

GWideCodeML is a pipeline written in Python useful for testing evolutionary hypothesis (branch-site model) at genome-wide level. 

This pipeline is divided in two main parts. The first part of the pipeline is optional
as it is the part for getting the database with the alignments and tree file necessary to run GWideCodeML. 

1. Database creation: alignment files and species tree.
2. Testing branch-site model in a set of alignment files (Database), likelihood ratio tests performance on the results obtained and selection of the significant ones and their sites under positive selection (BEB).
