# GWideCodeML


GWideCodeML is a Python package that provides support for testing evolutionary hypothesis using codeml (from the PAML package) in a genome-wide framework.


For further information on installation and usage, please visit https://github.com/lauguma/GWideCodeML/wiki

## Installation
### Option 1:

1. Download GWideCodeML
`git clone https://github.com/lauguma/GWideCodeML.git`
`cd GWideCodeML`

2. Install
`python setup.py install`

3. Run GWideCodeML: if succesfull installation, gwidecodeml executable is created. You can check it by writing in your console:
`gwidecodeml -h`

Note: if you choose this options all requirements must be satisfaied before running GWideCodeML (e.g. codeml must be installed and available from the working directory), see Requirements section.

### Option 2: conda environment 
(easier, recommended option)

1. Download GWideCodeML
`git clone https://github.com/lauguma/GWideCodeML.git`
`cd GWideCodeML`

2. Create a conda environment from yml file
`conda env create -f gwidecodeml_conda.yml`

3. Activate conda environment
`conda activate gwcodeml`

4. Install and run GWideCodeML
`python setup.py install`
`gwidecodeml -h`
